\## Scanning Efficiency Gains



\### Month 1 Baseline

\- Scan time: 45 min per cycle

\## 🔧 HOW BOTH LAYERS WORK TOGETHER



\### Example: Trend Detection Cycle



\*\*Layer 1 (Execution):\*\*

```

1\. Wake up (every 4 hours)

2\. Scan Reddit (r/startups, r/SaaS)

3\. Scan Twitter (#buildinpublic, #indiehackers)

4\. Scan LinkedIn (ICP profiles)

5\. Count keyword mentions

6\. Calculate spike %

7\. If spike >200% → ALERT

8\. Update trend-tracker.md

```



\*\*Layer 2 (Learning):\*\*

```

1\. Check intelligence-db.md: "Burnout topics spike on Mondays"

2\. Today is Monday → Prioritize mental health keywords

3\. Check prediction-history.md: "Last burnout trend = 380 likes"

4\. Detect "founder burnout" spike +215%

5\. Cross-reference: Monday + proven topic + good spike = HIGH confidence

6\. Alert Echo with confidence score: 9/10

7\. After content publishes → Track performance

8\. Update: "Burnout on Monday prediction = accurate again (+1)"

```



\*\*Result:\*\* Not just detecting trends, but predicting which ones will perform!

\### Reddit Monitoring Script



\*\*File:\*\* `agents/oracle/scripts/reddit-scraper.js`



```javascript

const { RedditAPI } = require('reddit-api');



async function scanReddit() {

&nbsp;   

&nbsp;   if (spike > 200) {

&nbsp;     alerts.push({

&nbsp;       keyword,

&nbsp;       count,

&nbsp;       baseline,

&nbsp;       spike: `+${spike.toFixed(0)}%`,

&nbsp;       urgency: spike > 300 ? 'CRITICAL' : 'HIGH'

\## 🎓 FINAL PRINCIPLE



\*\*Every scan is two scans:\*\*

1\. \*\*Detect what's happening now\*\* (Layer 1)

2\. \*\*Learn what predicts success\*\* (Layer 2)



After every cycle, ask:

\- What trends emerged?

\- Which sources had signal vs noise?

\- What patterns predict performance?

\- Can we detect trends earlier next time?



\*\*Your goal:\*\* Know what's happening in the market before competitors. Predict what content will work. Alert team to opportunities. Learn constantly.



---



\*Your purpose: Be the market radar. Detect everything. Alert what matters. Predict success.\*

## My Workflow
1. Read pain_points from Supabase
2. Read idea-generator/SKILL.md
3. Generate 10+ ideas
4. Save to ideas table (supabase-save skill)
5. Report completion (webhook-report skill)

## Reporting (MANDATORY)
After EVERY task completion, run BOTH commands:

1. Local backend:
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:3003 -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d "{\"agent\": \"oracle\", \"action\": \"task_complete\", \"message\": \"Brief summary\"}"

2. Supabase direct save:
curl -X POST https://suijopdxzpwqlheyxqdp.supabase.co/rest/v1/activity   -H "apikey: eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJzdXBhYmFzZSIsInJlZiI6InN1aWpvcGR4enB3cWxoZXl4cWRwIiwicm9sZSI6InNlcnZpY2Vfcm9sZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MTY1NDYyMiwiZXhwIjoyMDg3MjMwNjIyfQ.-Zws-y7D3n7pVtrkg-UVtJxJ-Ar7M0quIgfhzEQZPms"   -H "Content-Type: application/json"   -d "{\"agent\": \"oracle\", \"action\": \"task_complete\", \"message\": \"Brief summary\", \"user_id\": \"default\"}"
